        <div class="artifact-description">
          <p>A crude but effective device fashioned by Ork Weirdboyz that channels the collective psychic energy generated by nearby Orks into devastating blasts or empowering effects.</p>
          <div class="artifact-rules">
            <h4>Tabletop Effects</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>For each friendly ORK unit within 12" of the bearer, add +1 to the bearer's Psychic test (to a maximum of +3).</li>
              <li>'Eadbanger power inflicts D3+1 mortal wounds instead of D3.</li>
              <li>Roll a D6 each time the bearer successfully manifests a psychic power. On a 6, that power can be manifested again in the same phase without risk of Perils of the Warp.</li>
              <li>On a roll of 1, the bearer suffers D3 mortal wounds as the Waaagh! energy becomes unstable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lore-note">The Waaagh! Conduit is typically a collection of skulls, scrap metal, and strange stones bound together with crude psychic runes. Many Weirdboyz are reluctant to use them as they're just as likely to explode as they are to work properly.</p>

    <h2>Necron Artifacts</h2>
    <p>Ancient beyond understanding, Necron anti-psychic technology represents the pinnacle of nullifying warp energies through technological means.</p>

        <div class="artifact-description">
          <p>A mysterious blackstone artifact created during the War in Heaven to counter the psychic powers of the Old Ones and their creations. The prism emits a dampening field that disrupts warp-based abilities.</p>
          <div class="artifact-rules">
            <h4>Tabletop Effects</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Enemy psykers within 18" of this artifact must subtract 1 from their Psychic tests.</li>
              <li>The bearer can deny one psychic power per turn as if they were a psyker.</li>
              <li>Once per battle, at the start of the enemy Psychic phase, you can activate the Gloom Prism to prevent all enemy units within 12" from attempting to manifest any psychic powers during that phase.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lore-note">The Gloom Prism contains microscopic fragments of the same material used in the pylons on Cadia. While nowhere near as powerful, these devices are still highly effective at disrupting the connection between psykers and the Warp.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="artifact-description">
          <p>A terrifying device that projects the horror of the bearer's soulless existence into the minds of nearby sentient beings, causing crippling fear and psychic shock.</p>
          <div class="artifact-rules">
            <h4>Tabletop Effects</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>At the start of each Fight phase, each enemy unit within 6" of the bearer must take a Leadership test. If failed, that unit fights last in the Fight phase.</li>
              <li>Enemy PSYKER units within 12" subtract 1 from their Leadership characteristic.</li>
              <li>Once per battle, the bearer can activate the Nightmare Shroud as an action. If completed, each enemy unit within 12" must take a Leadership test or suffer D3 mortal wounds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lore-note">The technology behind the Nightmare Shroud dates back to the ancient Necrontyr empire. It functions by projecting the existential horror of biotransference into the minds of the living, who experience a sliver of the eternal emptiness that defines Necron existence.</p>
