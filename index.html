      <h2>The Gift and the Curse</h2>
      <p>In the dark future of the 41st millennium, psykers are humans born with the ability to tap into the immaterial realm known as the Warp. While these powers make them invaluable to the Imperium, they also make them dangerous and feared.</p>
      <div class="lore-entry">
        <h3>The Black Ships</h3>
        <p>Every day, thousands of psykers manifest their powers across the Imperium. The Black Ships of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica travel from world to world, collecting these individuals before they can cause catastrophe. Many become sanctioned psykers serving the Imperium, while others feed the insatiable hunger of the Golden Throne...</p>
      </div>
      <div class="lore-entry">
        <h3>The Soul Binding</h3>
        <p>Those psykers deemed useful to the Imperium undergo the Soul Binding ritual, where they gaze upon a fraction of the Emperor's radiance. This painful process either kills them, drives them insane, or renders them blindâ€”but also helps protect them from daemonic possession and gives them greater control over their abilities.</p>

      <h2>Perils of the Warp</h2>
      <p>Every time a psyker draws upon the immaterium, they risk attracting the attention of the predatory entities that dwell there. These "Perils of the Warp" can manifest as:</p>
      <ul class="perils-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Daemonic Possession</strong> - The ultimate risk for any psyker, where a warp entity takes control of their body</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Psychic Backlash</strong> - Uncontrolled energies rebounding into the psyker's mind</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Warp Rifts</strong> - Temporary tears in reality that allow daemons to enter realspace</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mind Burns</strong> - Neural damage that can leave a psyker catatonic or worse</li>
      </ul>

          <h3>Sanctioned Imperial Psykers</h3>
          <p>These are psykers who have been officially approved by the Imperium and have undergone the Soul Binding ritual with the Emperor. They serve in various Imperial institutions including the Astra Telepathica and Imperial Guard.</p>
          <p>Their psychic signatures are characterized by controlled <span class="highlight-blue">blue-green energy</span> manifestations and regulated power outputs.</p>

        <div class="psyker-type librarian-psyker">
          <h3>Librarian Space Marines</h3>
          <p>Elite psychic warriors of the Adeptus Astartes, Librarians are among the most disciplined and powerful psykers in the Imperium. Their training allows them to harness warp energy with precision while resisting corruption.</p>
          <p>Their psychic manifestations often appear as <span class="highlight-librarian">deep blue</span> energy constructs, representing their unwavering loyalty to the Emperor.</p>

        <div class="psyker-type untrained-psyker">
          <h3>Untrained Wild Talents</h3>
          <p>Discovered throughout Imperial worlds, these individuals manifest psychic abilities without training or control. They are highly dangerous to themselves and others, often becoming gateways for demonic possession.</p>
          <p>Their unstable powers manifest as <span class="highlight-vibrant">vibrant, erratic energy</span> bursts that can be devastating and unpredictable.</p>

        <div class="psyker-type chaos-psyker">
          <h3>Chaos Sorcerers</h3>
          <p>Having given themselves to the Ruinous Powers, Chaos Sorcerers embrace corruption to gain tremendous psychic might. They channel the raw energy of the warp with little concern for the consequences.</p>
          <p>Their powers manifest as <span class="highlight-chaos">chaotic, fiery energy</span> mixed with warp distortions, reflecting their unstable connection to the Immaterium.</p>
