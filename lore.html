    <h2>The Nature of Psychic Power</h2>
    <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, psykers stand as both humanity's greatest asset and most terrible vulnerability. Connected to the Immaterium, they can manipulate reality itself, but always at great risk.</p>

    <h2>The History of Human Psykers</h2>
    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h3>The Age of Strife</h3>
      <p>During the Age of Strife, the emergence of psykers on human worlds often led to disaster. Untrained and vulnerable, these early psykers became gateways for daemonic entities, causing the downfall of countless civilizations as warp storms isolated human worlds from each other.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h3>The Emperor and the Primarchs</h3>
      <p>The Emperor of Mankind, the most powerful psyker in human history, understood the potential and danger of psychic abilities. Several of his created Primarchs inherited varying degrees of psychic talent, most notably Magnus the Red, whose Legion would become notorious for their psychic abilities.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h3>The Council of Nikaea</h3>
      <p>During the Great Crusade, the Emperor convened the Council of Nikaea to address the use of psychic powers among the Space Marine Legions. After much debate, the Emperor banned certain psychic practices and established strict controls, a decision that would have far-reaching consequences during the Horus Heresy.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h3>The Horus Heresy and Beyond</h3>
      <p>During the Horus Heresy, restrictions on psychic powers were often ignored by both loyalist and traitor forces. The psychic might of Magnus the Red and his Thousand Sons was unleashed fully, while loyalist Librarians found themselves needed despite the Emperor's decree. After the Heresy, the Imperium developed more formal structures for controlling and using psykers.</p>

    <h2>The Warp and the Psyker</h2>
    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h3>The Nature of the Immaterium</h3>
      <p>The Warp, also known as the Immaterium, is a dimension of pure psychic energy that underlies realspace. It is shaped by the emotions and thoughts of sentient beings, particularly the countless trillions of humans in the galaxy. This makes it a turbulent, dangerous realm filled with entities that feed on emotions and souls.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h3>The Connection</h3>
      <p>Psykers have a natural connection to the Warp that allows them to draw power from it and manipulate reality. The strength of this connection varies greatly between individuals, from barely detectable to catastrophically powerful. Without training, this connection is dangerous, as it can attract predatory warp entities.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h3>Perils of the Warp</h3>
      <p>Every time a psyker draws upon their powers, they risk attracting attention from the Warp. This can result in phenomena ranging from minor hallucinations to full daemonic possession or the creation of warp rifts that allow hordes of daemons to enter realspace. The stronger the psychic ability used, the greater the risk.</p>
