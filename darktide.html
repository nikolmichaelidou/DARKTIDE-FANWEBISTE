            <h2>Psyker Lore</h2>
            <h3>Who Are Psykers?</h3>
            <p>In the Imperium of Man, Psykers are sanctioned mutants capable of tapping into the Warp. This makes them incredibly dangerous but also incredibly useful. In Darktide, Psykers are one of the four playable classes and represent the most fragile but deadly role—wielding destructive Warp abilities instead of conventional weapons.</p>
            <h3>The Danger of the Warp</h3>
            <p>The Warp is a parallel dimension inhabited by chaotic entities, daemons, and psychic phenomena. Every time a Psyker draws power from the Warp, they risk exposure to these horrors. Overuse of psychic powers causes Peril, which can lead to catastrophic consequences like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brain-bursting Warp backlash</li>
                <li>Demonic possession</li>
                <li>Instantaneous death</li>
                <li>Catastrophic explosions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is reflected in the gameplay through the Peril mechanic—a meter that fills with every use of psychic abilities.</p>
